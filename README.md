## The Book - Microservices Architecture and Step by Step Implementation on .NET

If you buy my udemy courses with using above links, I will send this book.
You can find **Microservices Architecture and Step by Step Implementation on .NET book** which **step by step developing** this repository with extensive explanations and details. This book is the **best path to leverage your .NET skills** in every aspect from beginner to senior level you can benefit to ramp-up faster on **Enterprise Application Development practices** and easy to **Onboarding to Full Stack .Net Core Developer jobs**. 

The book also includes more practical information and I **update it regularly** and send it again with new versions.
So the idea is once you buy a book, I take this as **supporting me** and **join them in my privilege group** for sharing **next outputs**.
For example I am planning to add **IdentityServer4 implementation**, firstly I added it into a book and sent it to you.
